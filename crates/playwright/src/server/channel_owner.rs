// Channel Owner - Base trait for all Playwright protocol objects
//
// Architecture Reference:
// - Python: playwright-python/playwright/_impl/_connection.py (ChannelOwner class)
// - Java: playwright-java/.../impl/ChannelOwner.java
// - JavaScript: playwright/.../client/channelOwner.ts
//
// All Playwright objects (Browser, Page, etc.) implement ChannelOwner to:
// - Represent remote objects on the server via GUID
// - Participate in parent-child lifecycle management
// - Handle protocol events
// - Communicate via Channel proxy

/// Base trait for all Playwright protocol objects.
///
/// Every object in the Playwright protocol (Browser, Page, BrowserContext, etc.)
/// implements this trait to enable:
/// - GUID-based object identity and lookup
/// - Hierarchical parent-child lifecycle management
/// - Channel-based RPC communication
/// - Protocol event handling
///
/// # Architecture
///
/// All official Playwright bindings (Python, Java, .NET) follow this pattern:
///
/// 1. **GUID Identity**: Each object has a unique GUID from the server
/// 2. **Parent-Child Tree**: Objects form a hierarchy (e.g., Browser → BrowserContext → Page)
/// 3. **Dual Registry**: Objects are registered in both connection (global) and parent (lifecycle)
/// 4. **Channel Communication**: Objects send/receive messages via their Channel
/// 5. **Event Handling**: Protocol events are dispatched to objects by GUID
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```ignore
/// # use playwright_rs::server::channel_owner::ChannelOwner;
/// # use std::sync::Arc;
/// # fn example(browser: Arc<dyn ChannelOwner>) {
/// // Get object identity
/// println!("Object GUID: {}", browser.guid());
/// println!("Object type: {}", browser.type_name());
///
/// // Handle lifecycle
/// browser.dispose(playwright_rs::server::channel_owner::DisposeReason::Closed);
/// # }
/// ```
